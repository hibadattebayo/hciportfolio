			<h1>This is me!</h1>
			<h3>26-04-2019</h3>
			<p>Hi I am Hiba, I like to learn new stuff. I also like memes and netflix. I like food. I like designing stuff. In short, I like a lot of stuff :)		
			<br>
			<br>
			I don't have any specific expectations for this course. I am excited though, because the subjects (wearables, augmented reality etc.)
			are very interesting and I have never worked with these technologies. I am looking forward to the adventure of understanding more about the subjects
			(hopefully) and expanding my horizons.
			<br>
			<br>
			I want to learn everything there is to learn within this course (for the subject I will be choosing). I want to learn more about
			human computer interaction since this is a very new area of expertise for me, but I would also like to build stuff since I have never really made "something" like this before. When I come
			out of this course, I hope to be able to say I learned more and did something out of my own comfort zone.
			</p>
