			<h1>Topic: Wearables</h1>
			<h3>Assignment A - BrainCo's Focus 1</h3>
			<p>For this assignment we had to search for an example of a wearable using biometric brainwave data. Wearables that use this data read information that comes from your brain (duh!). I don't exactly
			know how it works in it's entirety because I am no genius but I can tell you that it's pretty amazing.<br><br></p>
			<p>I found something very interesting and kind of scary. No really, this device could actually be featured in an episode of Black Mirror and I wouldn't find it weird. The device I will be describing is 
			the Focus 1. The Focus 1 is the world's first wearable device that is designed to detect and analyse users attention levels.
			According to their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ3eW3qQ2pk#action=share" target="blank">video on YouTube</a>, the Focus 1
			translates brain signals into attention level. This means it makes use of biometric brainwave data. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The device is worn by students and helps teachers to see who is paying attention to class. The outside of the wearable
			shares similarities with an average headband, the only difference is that it is placed on the forehead. 
			<br>
			<br>
			If a student doesn't pay attention in class, the Focus 1 will emit a red 
			light which will also appear on the screen of the teacher. This is a signal for the teacher to help students in need, or to change up the lecture to make it more engaging and 
			intersting for the pupils.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h3>Assignment B: Reflection</h3>
			<p>I found it interesting to research the area of wearables. I saw a lot of different technologies for both the brainwave data and smart tattoos. I have never really been interested in wearables before
			to be honest. A lot of my friends have smartwatches, fitbits and that kind of stuff but I have never really paid attention to it. Until Tim told us more about it during his lecture. It was an eyeopener for me to search
			for new kinds of technologies regarding wearables. It made me realise how far we have progressed on the area of technology. I know it sounds like I have been living under a stone but it is so cool to see!</p>

			<h1>Topic: Playful interfaces</h1>
			<h3>Assignment A: AWTA (Airhockey Without The Air)</h3>
			<p>Airhockey without the air is the classic game of airhockey translated to a playful interface. Games always liven up the mood and cause positive behaviour most of the time.
			The interaction between the players of the game is that they have to pass the puck from one to another. The movements of the players are the input and the output is the hockey game functioning.
			Air hockey without the air is a multiplayer game that is an interdepent exertion with a shared object, the puck.
			<br>
			<br></p>
			<h3>Assignment B: Research - Hatsune Miku</h3>
			<p>For this assignment we had to look for a playful interface that wasn't mentioned during class. What I found is not neccesarily something that completely fits the description, but I had to mention
				it because it is super cool. If you click on the video on the left you will see what I will be describing.
				In Japan there's this Idol called Hatsune Miku. Nothing weird right? Except for the fact that she is not a real person, she is a projection. Miku is very populair in Japan and she is not the only one
				of her kind. She's accompanied by other friends of her kind, the vocaloids.
				The purpose of this 'interface' is quite easy. It is a concert. And like any normal concert there is, there's a band, an audience, but the singer is a projection! There is literally a projector
				that makes it seem like she is standing on the stage. The output technology that the users (or the audience) experience are sound, aka the music and sight, aka Hatsune Miku herself.
				<br>
			<br></p>
			<h3>Assignment C: Reflection</h3>
			<p>I have always found playful interfaces very interesting. Whenever I'd enter a store with one of those projectors on the ground I would freak out, and I still do because it's awesome.
			I do see a future for playful interfaces, as screens are becoming more and more basic. Playful interfaces can be used to motivate people to do things (like the example of the
			interface where you had to hold onto a pipe and try not to fall off). And of course they add some more fun to the world. This is a subject that will always amaze me, just like all the other HCI 
			technologies.</p>

			<h1>Topic: Artificial Creatures</h1>
			<h3>Assignment A - Printer-chan</h3>
			<p>For this assignment we were asked to apply the Homeostasis Model to a device. The homeostasis model = the needs that a machine/body needs in order to function.
			In the lecture, Chris told us about the needs of a robot vaccuum cleaner. These were: energy, dust and safety. He explained that having certain needs will change the behaviour of the vaccuum cleaner.
			If its filled with dust and the energy is low, the machine will go to it's base and wait to be charged. This is just an example of the many examples that were given in the lecture.
			We got four devices to choose from for this assignment and I went with a printer.
			Printer-chan (yes, she has a name now) has 3 basic needs in my opinion. These are: ink, paper and connection to another device. <br><br>
			When all the three needs are being met, Printer-chan feels happy and fullfilled. Her ink is full, she has enough paper in her belly and she is connected to another device.
			She can help with any task whenever her human is ready.<br><br>
			When Printer-chan's ink and paper are full but she can't make a connection to another device she gets uneasy and mad because she can't find another device. Eventually she will cool down
			and switch into standby mode until she gets a task.<br><br>
			When Printer-chan is connected to another device but ran out of paper and/or ink she will feel empty because she needs ink and paper to function, which eventually will make her sad. She will 
			ask her human for more paper/ink so that she can satisfy her human's needs.
			<br><br></p>
			<h3>Assignment B: Reflection</h3>
			<p>If I look back on making this excersise I think I genuinely had fun with it. It is fascinating to think about your machines as living being with emotions and feelings. Giving a printer emotions and a name
			really makes you think about how it functions and how it would feel if it was a living being.</p>

			<h1>Topic: AR & VR</h1>
			<p>You have probably heard of Augmented reality (AR) and Virtual reality (VR) before. The one adds technology to the real world, such as the kickass glasses cookie had in ned survival gids. And the other
			creates a whole new virtual environment that users get sucked up in by putting on their VR glasses. For this assignment we had to come up with three new idea's in these fields 
			within a set of given themes and we also had to research existing AR and VR projects. I will discuss everything below. Have fun reading! <br><br></p>
			<h3>Assignment A - Own concepts</h3>
			<p>Concept 1 - The tony stark: Okay, so even though this concept is called after iron man I mainly drew my inspiration from a movie I watched recently. It is called See You Yesterday and it is
			about two friends that try to build time traveling devices but end up messing things up. One thing that stood out to me is that they used VR glasses to view the inside of their machines virtually. It's
			similar to tony stark viewing his Mark I suit in the scene where he builds the Mark II (view the video on your right). Instead of actually looking at the anatomy of their machines the characters in these movies use VR and AR to view it virtually.
			That's what brings me to the following question. Why not do the same with school? Instead of letting students learn from a boring book, why not let them experience the stuff they have to learn.
			I mean, it would be so much cooler to view a brain in VR than to just see an image in a book.
			<br><br></p>
			<p>Concept 2 - Cure your phobia with AR:
			I honestly don't know if this already exists but I came up with this idea from my own experience. See, I am a tough girl. But however, when I see an insect I freak out. Like actually freak out.
			But how cool would it be, if we could use AR to make it seem as if you are standing face to face with your greatest fear? In my case it's insects but it could also be heights, clowns, or whatever. 
			By using AR gear we can interpret certain parts from the real world and add a virtual layer on top of that (for example, a floor covered in cockroaches).
			<br><br>
			<p>Concept 3 - Dora's AR map: For this last idea I thought of a concept that will use AR for public transport. This concept is as simple as that sounds. Just imagine yourself wearing special kinds of glasses
			that would make you see arrows of which way you have to go. It is almost like an updated version of google maps. You set your location on your phone, laptop, or whatever. And the data get sent to the glasses your wearing which makes you see
			the directions towards the destination you have to be at. The only difference is that with google maps I still manage to go the wrong way sometimes. With this AR dora map that can't go wrong anymore.
			<br><br></p>
			<h3>Assignment B - Research existing concepts</h3>
			<p>One VR game that will never fail to amaze me is VRChat. Yes you saw that right, but hear me out and calm your tits before you roast me. VR chat is a game where you can be almost any character 
			you want to be. From Mario to ugandan knuckles. But that isn't everything. You play with other real time users. Aside from the graphics, the game also uses sound input and output.
			This makes it possible to talk with other people from around the world. Isn't that great? I mean the game itself doesn't have much of a goal. But the possibilities with it are awesome sauce.
			Please take a look at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmXEOLlX-Hk" target="blank">video</a> and see how a guy follows a cute innocent kid named Jordan around in VRChat (it's super cute).<br><br></p>
			<h3>Assignment C - AR & VR workshop</h3>
			<p>View Workshops>AR & VR for everything that has to do with the unreal engine assignment!<br><br></p>
			<h3>Assignment D: Reflection</h3>
			<p>As I look back on this excercise I realise that I had a lot of fun with it as well (I know I keep saying I had fun with all the excersises and I guess you could call me a nerd for that HAHA). It is nice to think
			about your own solutions in the subjects we were given. I find myself always drawing inspiration from things I have thought about or things I have seen before. I am interested in furtiristic movies that use technologies like AR and VR
			and thinking about your own solutions is a really enriching thing to do.</p>
