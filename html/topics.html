			<h1>Topic: Wearables</h1>
			<h3>BrainCo's Focus 1</h3>
			<p>The Focus 1 is the world's first wearable device that is designed to detect and analyse users attention levels.
			According to their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ3eW3qQ2pk#action=share" target="blank">video on YouTube</a>, the Focus 1
			translates brain signals into attention level. This means it makes use of biometric brainwave data. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The device is worn by students and helps teachers to see who is paying attention to class. The outside of the wearable
			shares similarities with an average headband, the only difference is that it is placed on the forehead. 
			<br>
			<br>
			If a student doesn't pay attention in class, the Focus 1 will emit a red 
			light which will also appear on the screen of the teacher. This is a signal for the teacher to help students in need, or to change up the lecture to make it more engaging and 
			intersting for the pupils.

			<h1>Topic: Playful interfaces</h1>
			<h3>Assignment A: AWTA (Airhockey Without The Air)</h3>
			<p>Airhockey without the air is the classic game of airhockey translated to a playful interface. Games always liven up the mood and cause positive behaviour most of the time.
			The interaction between the players of the game is that they have to pass the puck from one to another. The movements of the players are the input and the output is the hockey game functioning.
			Air hockey without the air is a multiplayer game that is an interdepent exertion with a shared object, the puck.
			<br>
			<br></p>
			<h3>Assignment B: Research</h3>
			<p>Description
 					URL
 					Describe the purpose of the interface
 					Describe how the installation works technically
 					Input technology
 					Output technology
 					Indicate and explain the type of play modus
			<br>
			<br></p>
			<h3>Assignment C: Reflection</h3>
			<p>I have always found playful interfaces very interesting. Whenever I'd enter a store with one of those projectors on the ground I would freak out, and I still do because it's awesome.
			I do see a future for playful interfaces, as screens are becoming more and more basic. Playful interfaces can be used to motivate people to do things (like the example of the
			interface where you had to hold onto a pipe and try not to fall off). And of course they add some more fun to the world. This is a subject that will always amaze me, just like all the other HCI 
			technologies.</p>

			<h1>Topic: Artificial Creatures</h1>
			<p>A gathering place of your own research within this topic. Do not 
			just give a reference / link to cool projects, but describe in your own words
			what you have found and what this means (eg for a user, for the field, to you). Why is this so interesting?</p>
			<br>
			<p>How do you view this topic within your own life, society and the future? What did you consider the 
			most valuable aspect of this topic? </p>
