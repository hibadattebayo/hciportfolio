			<h1>Topic: Wearables</h1>
			<h3>Assignment A - BrainCo's Focus 1</h3>
			<p>For this assignment we had to search for an example of a wearable using biometric brainwave data. Wearables that use this data read information that comes from your brain (duh!). I don't exactly
			know how it works in it's entirety because I am no genius but I can tell you that it's pretty amazing.<br><br></p>
			<p>I found something very interesting and kind of scary. No really, this device could actually be featured in an episode of Black Mirror and I wouldn't find it weird. The device I will be describing is 
			the Focus 1. The Focus 1 is the world's first wearable device that is designed to detect and analyse users attention levels.
			According to their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ3eW3qQ2pk#action=share" target="blank">video on YouTube</a>, the Focus 1
			translates brain signals into attention level. This means it makes use of biometric brainwave data. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The device is worn by students and helps teachers to see who is paying attention to class. The outside of the wearable
			shares similarities with an average headband, the only difference is that it is placed on the forehead. 
			<br>
			<br>
			If a student doesn't pay attention in class, the Focus 1 will emit a red 
			light which will also appear on the screen of the teacher. This is a signal for the teacher to help students in need, or to change up the lecture to make it more engaging and 
			intersting for the pupils.

			<h1>Topic: Playful interfaces</h1>
			<h3>Assignment A: AWTA (Airhockey Without The Air)</h3>
			<p>Airhockey without the air is the classic game of airhockey translated to a playful interface. Games always liven up the mood and cause positive behaviour most of the time.
			The interaction between the players of the game is that they have to pass the puck from one to another. The movements of the players are the input and the output is the hockey game functioning.
			Air hockey without the air is a multiplayer game that is an interdepent exertion with a shared object, the puck.
			<br>
			<br></p>
			<h3>Assignment B: Research - Hatsune Miku</h3>
			<p>For this assignment we had to look for a playful interface that wasn't mentioned during class. What I found is not neccesarily something that completely fits the description, but I had to mention
				it because it is super cool. If you click on the video on the left you will see what I will be describing.
				In Japan there's this Idol called Hatsune Miku. Nothing weird right? Except for the fact that she is not a real person, she is a projection. Miku is very populair in Japan and she is not the only one
				of her kind. She's accompanied by other friends of her kind, the vocaloids.
				The purpose of this 'interface' is quite easy. It is a concert. And like any normal concert there is, there's a band, an audience, but the singer is a projection! There is literally a projector
				that makes it seem like she is standing on the stage. The output technology that the users (or the audience) experience are sound, aka the music and sight, aka Hatsune Miku herself.
				<br>
			<br></p>
			<h3>Assignment C: Reflection</h3>
			<p>I have always found playful interfaces very interesting. Whenever I'd enter a store with one of those projectors on the ground I would freak out, and I still do because it's awesome.
			I do see a future for playful interfaces, as screens are becoming more and more basic. Playful interfaces can be used to motivate people to do things (like the example of the
			interface where you had to hold onto a pipe and try not to fall off). And of course they add some more fun to the world. This is a subject that will always amaze me, just like all the other HCI 
			technologies.</p>

			<h1>Topic: Artificial Creatures</h1>
			<h3>Assignment A - Printer-chan</h3>
			<p>For this assignment we were asked to apply the Homeostasis Model to a device. The homeostasis model = the needs that a machine/body needs in order to function.
			In the lecture, Chris told us about the needs of a robot vaccuum cleaner. These were: energy, dust and safety. He explained that having certain needs will change the behaviour of the vaccuum cleaner.
			If its filled with dust and the energy is low, the machine will go to it's base and wait to be charged. This is just an example of the many examples that were given in the lecture.
			We got four devices to choose from for this assignment and I went with a printer.
			Printer-chan (yes, she has a name now) has 3 basic needs in my opinion. These are: ink, paper and connection to another device. <br><br>
			When all the three needs are being met, Printer-chan feels happy and fullfilled. Her ink is full, she has enough paper in her belly and she is connected to another device.
			She can help with any task whenever her human is ready.<br><br>
			When Printer-chan's ink and paper are full but she can't make a connection to another device she gets uneasy and mad because she can't find another device. Eventually she will cool down
			and switch into standby mode until she gets a task.<br><br>
			When Printer-chan is connected to another device but ran out of paper and/or ink she will feel empty because she needs ink and paper to function, which eventually will make her sad. She will 
			ask her human for more paper/ink so that she can satisfy her human's needs.
