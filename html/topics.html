			<h1>BrainCo's Focus 1</h1>
			<p>The Focus 1 is the world's first wearable device that is designed to detect and analyse users attention levels.
			According to their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ3eW3qQ2pk#action=share" target="blank">video on YouTube</a>, the Focus 1
			translates brain signals into attention level. This means it makes use of biometric brainwave data. The device is worn by students and helps teachers to see who is paying attention to class. The outside of the wearable
			shares similarities with an average headband, the only difference is that it is placed on the forehead. If a student doesn't pay attention in class, the Focus 1 will emit a red 
			light which will also appear on the screen of the teacher. This is a signal for the teacher to help students in need, or to change up the lecture to make it more engaging and 
			intersting for the pupils.
