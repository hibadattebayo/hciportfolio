			<h1>Day 1 - Monday 3th June 2019</h1>
			<p>Day one of the lab weeks started off weirdly. We were given a location close to HHS, called Maakhaven, which was apparently an abondoned factory that now serves as the home of all kinds of artists and builders. 
			Even though it's close to my home and even though I had Google Maps by my side, I still managed to be confused by the route. I was staring off into space and when it seemed that all hope was lost
			I noticed someone waving at me. It was a classmate, Anne (shoutout to Anne because without her I'd still be lost till this day). We walked to Maakhaven together and when we entered we noticed
			that most people from our class were already present. After everyone was inside it was Chris his time to shine. He told us about the lab weeks, the rules of staying in maakhaven and above all what we could expect
			from these two weeks. Honestly, I still had no idea after his talk. It was weird to be given the task to just generate ideas without neccesarily having a goal because this was something I wasn't used to (as a school assignment).
			<br><br>After Chris' talk we got the lists with our teams and subjects and I didn't get my first choice which kind of made me cry internally. But I sucked it up and then encountered my fellow teammates: Danique, Yannick, Dennis and Nicolette.
			I had honestly never spoken to them before and that made me nervous but still excited in some kind of way because everything was so different from a normal workflow. We gathered around and talked a bit about ourselves, the subject and
			our own personal expertises. Me and Danique mentioned we both like designing and the others preferred programming. After that we started to brainstorm for ideas. We did individual and group brainstorms where
			we thought of things like a copy bot that copies your face, a Trojan Horse or maybe something like Baymax or a robot that reacts on light. After discussing possible functionalities and sensors we could use
			I got an idea. A dog. I don't know what triggered my brain to think of a dog but that was the moment Dog-E was born (we chose the name later on in the process). After that we decided to call ourselves the
			"The Doge Squad". 
			<br><br>After we chose our idea and a name we started experimenting with a redbot robot car. The instructions were in Chinese and luckily enough Dennis knows some of that. No, of course he doesn't.
			After trying several options we finally managed to build the bot. It was pretty useless though, because neither of us had their arduino with them so we could't do a lot after that. It did give us enough time to Think about the 
			tools we had to bring after monday though, we decided that we had to buy a motorshield. We also thought about what the dog had to do and first wanted to make a robot that could fetch a ball. After
			talking to Chris we realised it would be too hard to make that work, because bluetooth sensors can be inaccurate. So we thought of a dog that follows you around. Aside from helping and looking at the assembly of robot,
			I also made first sketches for our concept. I did this together with Danique.
			<br><br></p>
			<h3>REFLECT</h3>
			<p>If I look back to this day, I feel like we as a group didn't get a lot done. This was because we all went in there unprepared and not knowing what our subject would be. If I could change anything I would've
			brought an arduino with me. We wasted a lot of time on the first day because we didn't have a lot of things with us. Apart from that, I think if I could turn back time I would tell myself to be happy with 
			Artificial creatures as a topic. I was so bummed about getting second choice at first, but now that I look back I like all subjects equally and this one is really fun too!</p>

			<h1>Day 2 - Tuesday 4th June</h1>
			<p>Sadly enough I had to miss this day. I had Eid-ul-fitr which is a religious celebration that comes after the Ramadan. My group mates knew of this and gave me permission to skip it since they had to wait for the
			motorshield to arrive on this day anyways. They did send a few videos of what they were doing and also gave me a quick update when I asked for one on wednesday so that I could still be of help and not feel like I missed a lot.</p>

			<h1>Day 3 - Wednesday 5th June 2019</h1>
			<p>The day started with a daily standup of 20 minutes. We discussed what needed to be done and after this followed a guest lecture from a man which I don't remember the name of. I do remember one of his many projects though, Buqs. It was a lecture about artifical creatures and it was very inspiring.
			The main take away I took out of the talk he gave us was "Focus on the main tasks and make them simple." Deep innit?
			<br><br>After the guest lecture me and Danique started to design a second version of our concept, now more realistically than the first sketches.
			Danique brought two of her brother's plushies that we later sacrificed for the sake of science and doges (stay tuned, you will read more about that down here). Dennis and Yannick were busy trying to figure out how to put the ultrasound sensor on the redbot.
			It eventually worked, and we could see that in the serial monitor. We didn't test the ultrasound sensor on this day though. 
			<br><br>Aside from putting the ultrasound sensor on the bot we also fixed the problem
			of the bot not being able to drive straight. Aside from the technical stuff we also brainstormed for a name for our concept. We had a lot of name ideas but after asking a whole bunch of studetns and Tim, we came to the conclusion
			our dog would be baptised as the name that was chosen the most. There were so many good names like: Mr. Doge, K9, Lightning MCdoge, Good boi, etc. But eventually there was only one winner
			and thus, Dog-E was born. This name actually fits our name because we are the DOGE squad. It has a furturistic sound to it AND IT'S SIMILAR TO WALL-E.<br><br></p>
			<h3>REFLECT</h3>
			<p>I am actually content with everything we did on this day. It was productive and we were all motivated to finish the tasks we had given ourselves. GO TEAM DOGE SQUAD!</p>

			<h1>Day 4 - Thursday 6th June 2019</h1>
			<p>We started off the thursday with a daily standup of 15 minutes where we discussed what we wanted to get done on this day. We at least wanted to get the LED matrixes to work and to build the redbot with 4 wheels because
			we figured the one we had with 2 wheels wasn't quite the right one for Dog-E. Me and Danique worked on the LED matrixes and Dennis and Yannick worked on the robot car. We were very focused and I liked
			it that we were all working so hard. <br><br>
			Me and Danique struggled a lot with the code for the LEDs and after searching a million different codes and tutorials we still didn't find a way to create eyes for Dog-E. We did find a code that
			showed numbers and letters on the matrixes but we did not know how we could change the code for that to change into eyes. In the meantime the redbot started to come along thought.
			Danique and me decided to try and see if the servo motor would work for Dog-E's tail after trying to make the LED matrixes work but in vain. We played around with that a little and made a first version of a tail to see if it could work.
			It worked and it made us excited to work even harder on friday to get the LED's to work as well.<br><br></p>
			<h3>REFLECT</h3>
			<p>I wish I had asked a student or teacher for help with the LED matrixes. I always tr to solve things on my own, but with the HCI weeks being just two weeks I should've kept that in mind too.</p>
