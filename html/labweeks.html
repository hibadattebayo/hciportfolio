			<h1>Who is Dog-E? (view the video for the whole process + expo</h1>
			<h3>You better do it, the video may be a little long but it is actually fun!)</h3>
			<p><br>
			We were asked to describe our "product", I'd rather call Dog-E a creature though. Dog-E is an introverted dog that doesn't like to bump into people or stuff. His main function is literally to avoid to bump into stuff. 
			We created his vision with an ultrasound sensor (or proximity meter). Aside from the main function he also has two side functions. These are his "eyes" and his waggling tail.
			I am putting eyes between quotes because his real eyes are the ultrasound sensor. But to make him look nicer we used LED matrixes to serve as eyes so that people wouldn't think he is blind. 
			Next is his tail. His tail is just a simple servo motor that is attached to the back of his little butt.<br><br>
			Users seemed to almost immediately know what Dog-E's purpose was after they had engaged with him a little. They seemed to love to make him turn him in circles because he would be confused about where to 
			go if he kept seeing an obstacle. He lived a short and sad life of two weeks.<br><br>
			The reason why I think Dog-E is an artifical creature is because he is literally a creature and THAT'S THAT. No just kidding. A guest on the expo said that the fact we used a dog made it seem more
			alive and like a real dog. I think she captured the whole essence of what we were trying to do. We tried to make the bot seem like an actual dog and I think we did a good job at that, given the fact we 
			only worked on our little creature for 9 days.

			<h1>Day 1 - Monday 3th June 2019</h1>
			<p>Day one of the lab weeks started off weirdly. We were given a location close to HHS, called Maakhaven, which was apparently an abondoned factory that now serves as the home of all kinds of artists and builders. 
			Even though it's close to my home and even though I had Google Maps by my side, I still managed to be confused by the route. I was staring off into space and when it seemed that all hope was lost
			I noticed someone waving at me. It was a classmate, Anne (shoutout to Anne because without her I'd still be lost till this day). We walked to Maakhaven together and when we entered we noticed
			that most people from our class were already present. After everyone was inside it was Chris his time to shine. He told us about the lab weeks, the rules of staying in maakhaven and above all what we could expect
			from these two weeks. Honestly, I still had no idea after his talk. It was weird to be given the task to just generate ideas without neccesarily having a goal because this was something I wasn't used to (as a school assignment).
			<br><br>After Chris' talk we got the lists with our teams and subjects and I didn't get my first choice which kind of made me cry internally. But I sucked it up and then encountered my fellow teammates: Danique, Yannick, Dennis and Nicolette.
			I had honestly never spoken to them before and that made me nervous but still excited in some kind of way because everything was so different from a normal workflow. We gathered around and talked a bit about ourselves, the subject and
			our own personal expertises. Me and Danique mentioned we both like designing and the others preferred programming. After that we started to brainstorm for ideas. We did individual and group brainstorms where
			we thought of things like a copy bot that copies your face, a Trojan Horse or maybe something like Baymax or a robot that reacts on light. After discussing possible functionalities and sensors we could use
			I got an idea. A dog. I don't know what triggered my brain to think of a dog but that was the moment Dog-E was born (we chose the name later on in the process). After that we decided to call ourselves the
			"The Doge Squad". 
			<br><br>After we chose our idea and a name we started experimenting with a redbot robot car. The instructions were in Chinese and luckily enough Dennis knows some of that. No, of course he doesn't.
			After trying several options we finally managed to build the bot. It was pretty useless though, because neither of us had their arduino with them so we could't do a lot after that. It did give us enough time to Think about the 
			tools we had to bring after monday though, we decided that we had to buy a motorshield. We also thought about what the dog had to do and first wanted to make a robot that could fetch a ball. After
			talking to Chris we realised it would be too hard to make that work, because bluetooth sensors can be inaccurate. So we thought of a dog that follows you around. Aside from helping and looking at the assembly of robot,
			I also made first sketches for our concept. I did this together with Danique.
			<br><br></p>
			<h3>REFLECT</h3>
			<p>If I look back to this day, I feel like we as a group didn't get a lot done. This was because we all went in there unprepared and not knowing what our subject would be. If I could change anything I would've
			brought an arduino with me. We wasted a lot of time on the first day because we didn't have a lot of things with us. Apart from that, I think if I could turn back time I would tell myself to be happy with 
			Artificial creatures as a topic. I was so bummed about getting second choice at first, but now that I look back I like all subjects equally and this one is really fun too!</p>

			<h1>Day 2 - Tuesday 4th June - EID MUBARAK! &#9789;</h1>
			<p>Sadly enough I had to miss this day. I had Eid-ul-fitr which is a religious celebration that comes after the Ramadan. My group mates knew of this and gave me permission to skip it since they had to wait for the
			motorshield to arrive on this day anyways. They did send a few videos of what they were doing and also gave me a quick update when I asked for one on wednesday so that I could still be of help and not feel like I missed a lot.</p>

			<h1>Day 3 - Wednesday 5th June 2019</h1>
			<p>The day started with a daily standup of 20 minutes. We discussed what needed to be done and after this followed a guest lecture from a guy that came to talk about artificial creatures. He showed us
			a project where they digitalized conditional training with punishment with a mouse. The mouse had to learn to only fetch "cheese" and had to avoid the "lava". It was very interesting to see and I found it 
			amazing that they made an environment where the artifical creature COULD ACTUALLY LEARN.
			<br><br>After the guest lecture me and Danique started to design a second version of our concept, now more realistically than the first sketches.
			Danique brought two of her brother's plushies that we later sacrificed for the sake of science and doges (stay tuned, you will read more about that down here). Dennis and Yannick were busy trying to figure out how to put the ultrasound sensor on the redbot.
			It eventually worked, and we could see that in the serial monitor. We didn't test the ultrasound sensor on this day though. 
			<br><br>Aside from putting the ultrasound sensor on the bot we also fixed the problem
			of the bot not being able to drive straight. Aside from the technical stuff we also brainstormed for a name for our concept. Me and my groupmates had a lot of name ideas but after asking a whole bunch of studetns and Tim, we came to the conclusion
			our dog would be baptised as the name that was chosen the most. There were so many good names like: Mr. Doge, K9, Lightning MCdoge, Good boi, etc. But eventually there was only one winner
			and thus, Dog-E was born. This name actually fits our name because we are the DOGE squad. It has a furturistic sound to it AND IT'S SIMILAR TO WALL-E.<br><br></p>
			<h3>REFLECT</h3>
			<p>I am actually content with everything we did on this day. It was productive and we were all motivated to finish the tasks we had given ourselves. GO TEAM DOGE SQUAD!</p>

			<h1>Day 4 - Thursday 6th June 2019</h1>
			<p>We started off the thursday with a daily standup of 15 minutes where we discussed what we wanted to get done on this day. We at least wanted to get the LED matrixes to work and to build the redbot with 4 wheels because
			we figured the one we had with 2 wheels wasn't quite the right one for Dog-E. After this followed a guest lecture from a man which I don't remember the name of. I do remember one of his many projects though, Buqs. It was a lecture about artifical creatures and it was very inspiring.
			The main take away I took out of the talk he gave us was "Focus on the main tasks and make them simple." Deep innit? <br><br>
			Me and Danique worked on the LED matrixes and Dennis and Yannick worked on the robot car. We were very focused and I liked
			it that we were all working so hard. Me and Danique struggled a lot with the code for the LEDs and after searching a million different codes and tutorials we still didn't find a way to create eyes for Dog-E. We did find a code that
			showed numbers and letters on the matrixes but we did not know how we could change the code for that to change into eyes. In the meantime the redbot started to come along thought.
			Danique and me decided to try and see if the servo motor would work for Dog-E's tail after trying to make the LED matrixes work but in vain. We played around with that a little and made a first version of a tail to see if it could work.
			It worked and it made us excited to work even harder on friday to get the LED's to work as well.<br><br></p>
			<h3>REFLECT</h3>
			<p>I wish I had asked a student or teacher for help with the LED matrixes. I always try to solve things on my own, but with the HCI weeks being just two weeks I should've kept that in mind too.</p>
		  </div>
		  
		  <div class="assignments assignments5">
			<h1>Day 5 - Friday 7th June 2019</h1>
			<p>The fifth day started off with a daily standup of 12 minutes. We discussed all the things we had to do and after the guest lecture was over we immediatly started working. Me and Danique started working on the LED matrixes
			again and after a long time we finally found the way out. We found a code with blinking eyes, changed it up a bit and we were finally good to go. In the meantime I also had the honor to cut Dog-E open.
			Rip Dog-E. After that we removed the stuffing of the plushie, we also tried to place the LED matrixes in the holes where the eyes were going to be and played around with the position a bit. We also tested if
			the servo motor would work in the plushie we would use for the final prototype. It worked and that made us very excited. On this day we also managed to make the ultrasound sensor work. If the bot encountered anything in a 
			30 cm area it would back up. Dennis and Yannick also managed to make all four of the wheels turn instead of just two of them.</p>

		  <div class="assignments assignments6">
			<h1>Day 6 - Tuesday 11th June 2019</h1>
			<p>The sixth day started off with a short daily standup. We discussed what we had to do and went to work immediately. I started with making a blueprint of our robot because Chris adviced us it was a good idea to do so.
			I figured it would come in handy to be able to show where everything is positioned under the plushie for both our group and the people interested in our robot. It also showed what we needed and where we were going to place it.
			We also started to think in more details because we felt like the idea we had for our concept was too vague. We didn't know what we wanted Dog-E to do and we brainstormed about it again. We also tried to ask other students
			but in vain, so that resulted in that we had to do it ourselves. We concluded that our main goal was to make Dog-E back off when he sees an obstacle. After we determined this we could finally work in more details.
			We ordered a bigger battery pack and an extra ultrasound sensor. Ook hebben we besloten om het autootje te verhogen en om de wielsnelheid te verbeteren. Na te hebben gepast en geknipt paste de knuffel uiteindelijk
			ook over de robot heen.</p>

			<h1>Day 7 - Wednesday 12th June 2019</h1>
			<p>On the 7th day Nicolette told us she was gonna quit HCI. This meant we had to work together as four. We installed the second ultrasound sensor on the car. We didn't code it into the arduino though because we were still fighting the code of the first ultrasound. We also moved the arduino to the top of the car. and 
			managed all the cables neatly. We started to put the codes together because they were all seperate. The first one was for the servo. We attached it to the arduino and changed the code so that the servo would run with the wheels.
			We also attached the LED matrixes on the arduino board and put the code in the final code snippet. It was a lot of hassle BUT we got through it and at the end of the day we had combined the codes. They were not running seperately though, so we had to find a solution for that 
			on thursday. I started to feel the pressure of the deadline coming near and told my groupmates we had to work extra hard tommorow. At the end of the day we moved to the room we were going to do the expo in.</p>

			<h1>Day 8 - Thursday 13th June 2019</h1>
			<p>Today was the day we had set as our own deadline. We wanted Dog-E to fully function by noon 17.00. SPOILER ALERT we failed. We started the day with a broken doggo. We still had to fix the code of the LED matrixes.
			The problem was that the eyes weren't working together with the wheels, so everytime the ultrasound sensor picked something up, it stopped driving and the eyes started blinking. It was very fustrating because we had to experiment
			with different positions in the code after the day was over it still wasn't working completely. Yannick came with a solution but we had to wait to do it tommorow. This gave us extra motivation to work on Dog-E on friday. I was stressed but I trusted us and that we were gonna be able to make this. </p>
			<p>REFLECT HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>

			<h1>EXPO DAY - Friday 14th June 2019</h1>
			<h3>Expo video starts at 3.42 in the video all the way up!</h3>
			<p>I was one of the first students to enter Maakhaven on this day. My groupmates went to get a bluetooth speaker from the Action and I decided to try and fix the problem we were having on thursday.
			After playing around with the code the wheels still didn't work. My groupmates then came back and me and Yannick were thinking about what the problem was, because after reviewing the code multiple times we concluded the code was definetely not the problem.
			It then hit us. It were the batteries!<br><br>
			When we changed up the batteries, Dog-E worked perfectly fine. The stress was all for nothing after all. The rest of the time we had before the expo, we tried to make the code more optimal and make the response time of
			Dog-E shorter than it was now because the wheels were synched with the eyes now. Which meant the ultrasound sensor would only mesure if there was anything in its way after the LED matrixes would blink.
			We did not find a solution for this, because the only way out would be to use a second arduino to run the eyes on. But we did not have enough time left to put this at work. We did shorten the time of the eye blink tho,
			which resulted in the delay/response time being a little shorter. At 3 PM the pizzas arrived and it was time to eat and for Chris's speech. We then started the exposition. At first it was a little silent but after a while the people 
			started dripping in. A lot of creatures came by to see Dog-E in the first hour. I am saying creatures because it weren't just humans. Also dogs! Two of them to be exact. It was funny to see how scared they were
			of Dog-E. Good, they have recognised their future leader :). There were also a lot of classmates, other students, teachers, kids and older people. They all seemed to like Dog-E. Somewhat after an hour, Dog-Edecided to die on us.
			Man, that was a bummer. We didn't know what the problem was, so at first we tried to change up the batteries because that had been a problem before as well. Dog-E was still dead. We then unplugged all the cables and wires 
			and plugged them in again. Still did not work! After trying to figure out the problem and having all kinds of feelings about this we found the problem. It was the switch.<br><br>
			See, we put a switch on Dog-E to be able to turn off his wheels and without writing any code for it, the switch worked automatically. So, we decided to keep it that way. Somehow, the wheels became dependant on the switch.
			So when one of the soldered wires of the switch broke off, the wheels stopped functioning all together. Luckily for us there was Paul, who decided to put in a helping hand even though everyone was busy with the guests and everything.
			I want to personally thank Paul for this. We fixed the wires and made the wheels work again, but then the LED's decided to ditch us this time. The servo motor also didn't want to stay on its place anymore so we just removed
			the eyes and tail and sticked to the main function for the last two hours or so. We ended the expo with another speech of Chris, and after multiple rounds of applause we cleaned up after ourselves and went home.<br><br></p>
			
			<h3>REFLECT</h3>
			<p>If I look back on the whole process I must say that I learned a lot about arduino, teamwork and robotics. During the workshops in the first weeks we did learn a lot already, but I feel like we barely scratched the surface of all that is possible.
			I had never heard of motorshields before, I never knew you could connect wires without using a breadboard etc. Compared to when I started I feel like I have grown and that honestly feels amazing. I have experienced
			different kinds of emotions during these two weeks which range from stress and maddness to happiness and excitement. It was really nice to work together with a group of people I have never spoken to before.
