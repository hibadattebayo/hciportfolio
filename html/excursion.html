			<h1>Trip to Nemo museum</h1>
			<p>We went on an excursion to the NEMO museum during the week before the lab weeks. The NEMO museum is a museum with playful installations that have to do with science, physics, biology, technology, etc.
			The assignment we got was to find an installation we found the most interesting in a technological sense and to write about it.<br><br>
			I decided to write about an installation I found called the "tweede aarde" which translates to second earth (I am aware the pictures on your left are blurry, but this is what you will have to do it with SORRY). I found it interesting because it was about climate change and since it's a subject that
			has been on my mind lately I was attracted to find out the purpose of this installation. It works like this: you move the globe either left or right and the further it is from the sun, the better the situation on earth.
			The installation showed a different video for every touchpoint of the globe. When the globe was too close to the sun, the video would say that life on earth is impossible and that we all die. When it was the 
			furthest away, it said that mankind was safe from any harm. There was different information every time I would slide the globe to a certain position. One thing I do remember is that 
			one video stated that a certain point we might live in the skies of the earth someday, because the earth itself will be too hot. I found that a pretty interesting idea for a storyline of a future
			science fiction movie or something. JUST IMAGINE HOW COOL A STORY LIKE THAT WOULD BE. Or maybe we will be part of that story ourselves *dramatic tune*.
			<br><br>During the rest of my stay at the museum I learned a lot of new things regarding science and technology. It was a really cool experience to go to the museum, considering I never visited it before. 
			I learned that there are a lot of different ways to make learning more fun, which I am all in for since I love everything that has to do with fun. If there is something I should name that I didn't like about the trip, it is that the museum was really crowded. But this
			is an issue that can't really be helped.  I will definetly remember this excursion as an inspiration for my own creations and a cool + fun learning experience with my classmates. </p>
