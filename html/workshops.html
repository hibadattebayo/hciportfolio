			<h1>Arduino (view the video please!)</h1>
			<p>During the first two weeks of HCI technologies we learned to work with Arduino in the workshops. It was my first real experience with hardware and a different approach to coding. After all, all I know is HTML, CSS and JS.
			It was a really cool and enlighting experience for me and I had genuine fun with it, I felt like some kind of hacker :D. What i have learned from Arduino is that it's easier than you think to use code to control
			things like a LED, speaker, Servo motor etc. I really wonder how we are going to use the knowledge we have attained for the HCI weeks and I am looking forward to using it.<br><br></p>

			<h1>VR environments</h1>
			<p>For this workshop we learned how to work with unreal engine (UE) and MadMapper. Unreal Engine is a gaming engine that was used for the creation of a lot of games like Fortnite, Street Fighter V and many more.
			I read that UE uses C++ and that makes sense because it looked different from the coding languages I know. The program was pretty easy to use, once you knew where everything is placed + once you
			understand what the functions do. We used two tutorials that were easy to understand and that were fun. We ended up creating some kind of simple banana collecting game and it was awesome
			to see that I created something like this on my own (with a trustworthy tutorial by my side). The game kind of reminded me of mario kart because of the bananas.<br><br>
			MadMapper was a very nice program to work with as well. I loved to use a projector and this assignment was awesome because you had the freedom to make whatever you wanted. It was pretty easy to use and to understand even though
			it was my first time using it. I like how you can use shapes and backgrounds in real life and use MadMapper to map the footage you want over those shapes. The possibilities with this one are broad as hell and that makes me excited as well.

			<h1>Computer vision</h1>
			<p>For this assignment we learned more about processing as a continuation of one processing assignment we did in the first weeks of the HCI workshops. We worked with processing and openCV libraries. 
			For processing we made shapes with animations and different colors. For computer vision we used openCV libraries.
			It was supsrising how easy the libraries were to use and it was fascinating to see that the webcam of a laptop can recognise facial features so well. It is almost as if it has a brain on it's own. I have read on the internet that programs like this are trained
			to recognise details from faces like someones eyes or their nose.
			Sadly, the webcam on my own laptop didn't work, so William told me to try it out on someone else's laptop and that worked pretty fast. The code was fun to use and as soon as you got the hang of it, it became easier than I thought it would be at first.</p>
